## Project Description:

If I exist, it's because you need me.
Guide souls through the "river" and protect them from the devil's hand.
Tell them the truth and escort them to places they haven't been or want to go.
The "river" is located in the middle of the two worlds, and one must cross it after death.
Everyone has to cross their own “river".
Discover the truth of your obsession in this place, then re-experience and accept it.
Lead the soul to traverse more unseen places.
The journey is not smooth sailing,
A firm and brave heart can escort it to the final destination of the soul.
Flow is an adventure and survival game that takes about 7 minutes. The player controls a bottle protected
by a guardian spirit by using “ASWD” on keyboard so that it can successfully pass 4 levels and finally
reach the end of the game. Hope you like this game!
